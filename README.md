The hardest part of this project was to get the ERD organized and coded. Figuring out how these pieces were supposed to relate to one another was tricky and sometime conflicting. Once those patterns were established, it was fairly straightforward. The difficulty after the ERD was formatting the individual columns to be selected from the tables AND joining the tables in a sequence that allowed them to chain together and join with all the information included.
