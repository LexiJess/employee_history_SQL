Working in PostGres studio to wrangle, clean, and join datasets of employee history for a small-sized business. 

Beginning with an ERD to arrange the dataset with primary keys and other connections, I imported the code from the ERD to PostGres. The hardest part of this project was to get the ERD organized and coded. The difficulty after the ERD was formatting the individual columns to be selected from the tables AND joining the tables in a sequence that allowed them to chain together and join with all the information included. After that, the established patterns in the data shone through and creating the searchable database was fairly straightforward. Inner and outer joins make for fun returns!
