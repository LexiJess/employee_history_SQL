The files you will need are called "erd screenshot", "erd_schema", and "final_queries". I pushed to this repository a whole bunch of files. The code for each task withing in GitLab is inside and the files titled "Assignment 1" and so forth to "Assignment 8." The final file ("final_queries") has all of the code/queries in one file instead, if that's easier to work with.
I renamed the csv files (sorry, graders) to make them easier for me to remember; I hope that they're not too difficult for you to translate which one is which. If this is a seriouschallenge, let me know and we'll figure something out. An image file for the ERD is also included. 

The hardest part of this project was to get the ERD organized and coded. Once that was established, it was fairly straightforward. The difficulty after the ERD was formatting the 
individual columns to be selected from the tables AND joining the tables in a sequence that allowed them to chain together and join with all the information included. 

So yeah. This was mostly enjoyable "glorified googling." Thanks!
